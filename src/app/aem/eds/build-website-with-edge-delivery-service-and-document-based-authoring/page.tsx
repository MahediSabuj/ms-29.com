            Edge Delivery Services provides different options for authoring content via WYSIWYG authoring, headless authoring, or document based authoring.
            This article solely focuses on document based authoring that enables content creators to use familiar tools like Microsoft Word or Google Docs
            to write and structure content.
          </section>
          <section className="pt-4">
            This approach is particularly well suited for basic static websites and micro sites. By leveraging document based
            authoring, teams can maintain content workflows within their preferred writing tools while benefiting from AEM&apos;s scalable and fast delivery via Edge Services.

            <strong>Change Content Source to your Google Drive</strong>
          </h2>
          <section>
            In your fork of the Boilerplate GitHub repository, the site points to an <Link href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MGzOt7ubUh3gu7zhZIPb7R7dyRzG371j" className="text-blue-600" target="_blank">existing content source</Link> in Google Drive.
            The content is read-only, to make changes to the content, you need to create a new folder in your Google Drive and copy the content from the existing folder.
          </section>
          <section className="pt-4">
            To copy the content, follow these steps:
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 pt-1 pl-2.5">
              <li>Open the existing content source folder in Google Drive.</li>
              <li>Select all the files (nav, index, footer) you want to copy.</li>
              <li>Right-click and select <strong>Make a copy</strong>.</li>
              <li>Move the copied files to your new folder.</li>
            </ul>
            <div className="pt-1">
              Alternatively, you can also download the files and upload them to your new folder. But it requires to convert the downloaded <code className="code-inline">.docx</code> files back into
              native Google Docs, when you upload them to your folder in your Google Drive. Make sure the folder is shared with the Adobe Experience Manager user (<Link href="mailto:helix@adobe.com" className="text-blue-600">helix@adobe.com</Link>).

          </section>
          <section className="pt-4">
            Now that you have the content in your own folder, you need to update the reference in <code className="code-inline">fstab.yaml</code> in your GitHub repo. Copy/paste the folder URL from
            your Google Drive to <code className="code-inline">fstab.yaml</code>.
          </section>
          <h2 className="text-xl mt-4">
            <strong>Preview and Publish your Content</strong>
          </h2>
          <section>
            Once you update the content source, the preview and live URL will show  <code className="code-inline background">404 not found</code> error. This happens because the contents of the newly
            linked folder haven&apos;t been promoted to the preview and live environments yet.
          </section>
          <section className="pt-4">
            To preview and publish content, author has to install <Link href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/aem-sidekick/igkmdomcgoebiipaifhmpfjhbjccggml" target="_blank" className="text-blue-600">AEM Sidekick</Link> Chrome extension.
            After installing the extension in Chrome, make sure to pin it for quick and easy access.

            Navigate to the <strong>Google Drive folder</strong> and activate the AEM Sidekick by clicking on your pinned extension. A new toolbar will appear on the bottom of the screen.

              you should see the changes in your browser immediately.

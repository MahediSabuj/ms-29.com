        Like many developers, I started by taking notes&mdash;scribbling down solutions, documenting tricky bugs, and sharing insights
          with my team. Over time, I contributed to communities like <Link className="text-blue-600" target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/4304727/mahedi-sabuj">Stack Overflow</Link> and <Link className="text-blue-600" target="_blank" href="https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/17461470">Experience League</Link>, but my knowledge became scattered
        across different platforms.

        concept, or searching for best practices, I hope you find something useful here. Let&apos;s keep learning together!
